1. Abot project

It's a first little project on pygame
 I hope next projects be better than this
 
 At this project I don't did a good animations becouse the code structure turned out not the way I would like to see it, and so far it is difficult for me to navigate in such a code structure
      
 In the next project, I plan to do something similar to this, but with a more correct structure and more beautiful animation, more enemies, etc.

  1.1 I never created something like that, so I think it's did't turn out so bad
  
  1.2 You can run it:
